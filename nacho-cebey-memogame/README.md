# PokÃ©mon Memory Card Game

## Description

ðŸ‘‹ Hello! My name is Nacho, and this is my Jobathon project (Memory game).

I've chosen a simple architecture focused on components, dedicating a folder to each one and adding its own style file inside. In other cases, it might be better to opt for a completely separate styles folder, but due to the simplicity of the code, I decided to keep it this way.

Additionally, I created a couple of folders for hooks and services, where I separated some logic from the main component of my app (Game).

If you're reading this, thank you very much for your time. Any improvement or contribution is highly welcome.

Best regards, and may the force be with you!
